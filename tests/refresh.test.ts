// lb2-3 — the tiles must RE-READ the high score when the player comes back.
//
// The bug this file exists to kill: `main.ts` asks `getTopScore()` once, while it is
// building each tile. That number is then frozen for the life of the page. Play tempest,
// beat your best, hit Back — the tile still shows the old score.
//
// The half of it that a "just re-read on load" fix silently misses is the BFCache. On a
// back-navigation the browser restores the page *from memory*: the document is not rebuilt,
// module scope does not re-run, and `DOMContentLoaded` does not fire again. The one signal
// the browser does give us is `pageshow`, with `persisted: true`. So every test below drives
// a real `pageshow` — a cold-load-only fix passes nothing here.
//
// These tests deliberately go through the REAL bootstrap (`../src/main`) rather than calling
// a refresh function by name. Where the re-read entry point lives is Dev's call; that it
// happens, and what the player then sees, is not.
//
// The score source is a COOKIE (lb2-2 / ADR-0004), which is why "listen for a `storage`
// event" is not on the table: cookies do not fire one. `readTopScore` re-reads
// `document.cookie` on every call, so a fresh read genuinely sees a fresh score — the only
// thing missing is something to ask for it.
