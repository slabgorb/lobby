// grid floor and its mirrored ceiling, the bezel brackets, the marquee, the vignette
// — is static markup in index.html. All this does is fill the grid with one tile per
// registry game, and upgrade the typeface once the vector face lands.

// and nothing else needs to know. Scores are read best-effort per game — an
// unreadable one shows NO SCORE rather than blocking the page.

// The scores above are a snapshot, and the player is about to go and beat one. When they
// come back, `pageshow` is the only signal we are guaranteed to get: a back-navigation is
// usually served from the BFCache, which restores the page from memory — the document is
// not rebuilt, and nothing at this module scope runs a second time. (Hence `pageshow` and
// not `DOMContentLoaded`; and not a `storage` event either — the score now travels by
// cookie, and cookies fire no such event. ADR-0004.)
//
// It fires on the ordinary first load too, where the re-read simply reports the same
// numbers we just rendered. That is a harmless second read, and the price of not having to
// care which kind of load this was.
window.addEventListener('pageshow', () => refreshScores(games, getTopScore))

// Best-effort web font; the page already reads in the Orbitron/monospace fallback,
// so this just upgrades the typography once the face lands.
